A Chrome extension that leverages ChatGPT and Gemini APIs to analyze news articles for **bias**, **misinformation**, and **author credibility** the goal is to empower users to make informed decisions in today’s media landscape.

## 🧠 Project Overview

**VeriTruths** is a chrome app designed to enhance media literacy by providing real-time, AI-powered insights while users browse the web. Whether it’s a political article, opinion piece, or breaking news, VeriTruths gives readers a deeper look behind the content, who wrote it, and the crdibility.

This project began as part of a research assistantship at Rutgers University focused on using AI for digital media analysis and public awareness, and I am still improving it as new models are on the horizon.
