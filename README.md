# VeriTruths

A Chrome extension that leverages ChatGPT and Gemini APIs to analyze news articles for **bias**, **misinformation**, and **author credibility** the goal is to empower users to make informed decisions in today’s media landscape.

## Project Overview

**VeriTruths** is a chrome app designed to enhance media literacy by providing real-time, AI-powered insights while users browse the web. Whether it’s a political article, opinion piece, or breaking news, VeriTruths gives readers a deeper look behind the content, who wrote it, and the crdibility.

This project began as part of a research assistantship at Rutgers University focused on using AI for digital media analysis and public awareness, and I am still improving it as new models are on the horizon.

VeriTruths will now be student oriented, with new functionality aimed at assisting students with everything from research to reading. Beta coming in April om the Chrome Web Store!

## What did I use?

Front-End:
Built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript
utilized Netlify as well.

Back-End:
Utilizing Python-based bsckend using Flask, ensuring secure user data processing. 
SQLite / PostgreSQL for persistent storage / anonymity 
Privacy-First design approach, utilizing IP hashing/salting
Render / Vercel deployment (currently on Netlify) 


- **Chrome Extension API**
- **OpenAI ChatGPT API**
- **Gemini API (Google)**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Python** for back-end logic
- **JavaScript / HTML / CSS** for the UI

## Wait so how?

1. User visits a news article.
2. The extension extracts the visible content and metadata.
3. Text is passed through custom prompts to ChatGPT/Gemini.
4. AI returns structured insight: bias indicators, misinformation red flags, author profile.
5. Results are shown in a clean, minimal UI directly in the browser via a collapsable side window.
